                    <h3> Where it began </h3>
                    <p> Our journey started with a simple idea. To create a space where coffee meets connection. From the first pour to the last bite, The Cafe Project began as a dream to start with local ingredients right in front of our doorstep. Why travel far, when we can get great food in our community? Being able to support out local farmers and create their ingredients into incredible meals that bring people together.</p>

                    <h3> Our Values </h3>
                    <p> The power of local enables us to bring everyone together. We partner with small farmers to handpick the freshest ingredients for our menu, ensuring that every dish is a celebration of local flavours. The best part about it all is being able to see out local farmers and grocers every week and receiving the most beautiful fresh food, especially when the carrots are not straight. We love getting the ugly and wonky food, because they are extra special.</p>
